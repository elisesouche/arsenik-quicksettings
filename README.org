#+title: Arsenik QuickSettings

This GNOME extension adds an button in the quicksettings panel to enable or disable [[https://github.com/jtroo/kanata][Arsenik]].
To do so it simply activates or deactivates the systemd unit =kanata-arsenik.service=.
Thus it will only work for you if
- You are using Arsenik with [[https://github.com/jtroo/kanata][Kanata]]
- You manage the Kanata daemon with systemd
- Your systemd unit is named precisely =kanata-arsenik.service=.

This works for me, but if it is not okay for you please tell me and I may add a setting to change the name of the systemd unit.

** Installation

Just clone this repo into =~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions=. Then enable the extension in the Gnome Extension app.
I'll eventually package it for Nix.
